/*
 * Which integer between 1 and 10000 has the largest number of divisors, and how
 * many divisors does it have? Write a program to find the answers and print out
 * the results. It is possible that several integers in this range have the
 * same, maximum number of divisors. Your program only has to print out one of
 * them. An example in Subsection 3.4.2 discussed divisors. The source code for
 * that example is CountDivisors.java.
 * You might need some hints about how to find a maximum value. The basic idea
 * is to go through all the integers, keeping track of the largest number of
 * divisors that youâ€™ve seen so far. Also, keep track of the integer that had
 * that number of divisors.
